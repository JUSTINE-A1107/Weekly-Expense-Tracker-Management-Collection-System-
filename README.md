This system helps you manage your organization's finances by capturing receipts and invoices.
Tracking your spending on a regular basis can give you an accurate picture of where your money is going and where you'd like it to go instead. Then, by using a budget, you can accurately account for all the bills you need to pay going forward.
Tracking where your money is going is the process of writing down what you spend. You may use a little notebook to do this, a spreadsheet, an app on your phone or tablet, or other software programs. You can track as you spend money or you collect receipts and track at the end of the day or week.
